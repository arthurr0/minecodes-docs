# ðŸ›  Installation

### Requirements

Prepare a server with a Spigot engine or its fork for version 1.17 or higher. \
Install [**Vault**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) plugin on your server.

### First start-up

After uploading the plugin to your server, during the first start-up, the plugin will automatically shut down the server after loading the files. You should then proceed to the first plugin configuration described below.

### First configuration

In the plugins folder, find the folder named **minePlots** and then open the file **configuration.yml** located in that folder.&#x20;

As the first point, you should provide your license that you received from mineCodes, find the field **license-key:** and fill it in with your key.&#x20;

Then you should decide which database you want to use, we have 4 different types of databases (_FLAT, H2, MYSQL, MONGODB_), the first two types of databases are saved in files on the server and do not require any login information.
